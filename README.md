# AI_Integrated-Story-Making-Game
A web-based game where players create their own characters, define unique powers, and develop strategies to defeat opponents in a form of text input. Once all inputs are submitted, the game generates a battle story that showcases how the players' creations interact and compete. This project uses Socket.IO for multiplayer and integrates Hugging Face's serverless inference API for AI-powered content generation. Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct is used for text generation, while stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large generates images based on player inputs.
